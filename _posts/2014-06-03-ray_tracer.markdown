<div class="text general-margin">
This project was made at 42 school with C. In two weeks every student had to create his own basic ray tracer, 
followed by two other weeks with a team of four people. Only one fonction was provided : SetPixel(x, y, color).

Those videos are the result of 4 peoples impletementing all basic shapes (planes, cubes, sphere,
cones), lights (specular, diffuse, multiple), reflection and refraction.
Every team members was involve in all aspects but I implement alone Perlin Noise in purpose to 
distord normals and proceed to strange effects.

It's a CPU program and those videos are not in real time.
