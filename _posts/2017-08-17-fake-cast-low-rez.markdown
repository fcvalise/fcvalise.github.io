<strong>An attempt to use cellular automaton to create a competitive 1v1 game about casting.</strong><br><br>
The idea was to force the player to use fake casting (inspired by World of Warcraft).<br>
<br>
[WASD] Move [IJKL]<br>
[Q] Damage [U]<br>
[E] Shield [O]<br>
[R] Mute [P]<br>
<br>
The shield is mainly a fake target. Move to interrupt casting. Try to survive.<br>
You can play with some cellular automata rules with [1-7]<br>
