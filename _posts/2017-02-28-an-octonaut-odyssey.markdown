In this journey that mixes exploration, logic and platform sections, you are Octo, 
the amnesiac octopus. You'll discover with him wild planets, inhabited by strange 
and evolutive flora and fauna. You'll meet quirky characters, and gather robots to 
help Octo recover his capacities and repair his ship. You'll learn to move around 
and to evolve in a new and chaotic universe, as well as to avoid the traps that 
stand in Octo's way to desorient him.

Developped in C++ for PC, Mac and Linux, An Octonaut Odyssey is the result of a 
work performed by a team of enthusiasts. The game is unique mainly because it was 
entirely designed based on a simple SFML library, from the physics engine to the 
music, including animations and sound design. The different elements of the game 
are partly procedurally generated. The sceneries and the relief are the results of 
mathematical algorithms, that make of each and every planet, a unique and evolutive 
living place. An Octonaut Odyssey has much evolved from the beginning. First designed 
as a simple student project for the information-technology school « 42 », it became 
little by little a much more ambitious and personal project.
